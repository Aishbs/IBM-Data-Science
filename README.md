## SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction - Capstone Project

**Introduction**

This capstone project aims to predict the success rate of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings. This information can be used to determine the cost of a launch, which is significantly lower for SpaceX due to its ability to reuse the first stage.

**Business Problem**

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for $62 million, while other providers charge upwards of $165 million each. Much of this savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of its rockets. Therefore, if you can accurately predict the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing, you can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of your data science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

**Objective**

To apply data science and machine learning to accurately predict the likelihood of a successful first-stage rocket landing.

**Steps**

1. Collect and prepare the data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data and identify any patterns or trends.
3. Develop and train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing.
4. Evaluate the model on a held-out test set to assess its performance.
5. Deploy the model to production so that it can be used to predict the likelihood of a successful landing for future launches.

**Expected Outcomes**

* A machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a successful SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing.
* Insights into the factors that influence the success rate of first-stage landings.
* A more informed understanding of the cost of a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch.

**Conclusion**

This project will demonstrate the power of data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems. By accurately predicting the likelihood of a successful SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing, we can help a competitor determine the cost of a launch and bid more competitively against SpaceX.
